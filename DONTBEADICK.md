# Welcome to Fox's Magisk Module Manager community

Follow these rules in all channels:

1) Don't be a dick.
2) A dick do not be.
3) Review these rules 1â€“3.

Free speech and discussions are vital to community health. \
When everyone can speak freely, we all get along. \
Keep in mind, you must extend that same freedom to everyone else. \
This means letting contributors, community members, developers, and users alike speak their mind just as you have, \
without attempting to stifle their evenly matched freedom of speech or expression.

You are welcome to contact any maintainer privately if you need help or wish to report someone you can not come to terms with.

### Code contributions

All code submitted must follow existing code standards, including but not limited to, formatting, licensing, and code style. \
Code must also be the submitters own work or used under license, and the submitter must make a good faith effort \
to test and ensure it works correctly.
