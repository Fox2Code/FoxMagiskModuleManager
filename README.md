# Fox's Magisk Module Manager

The official Magisk is dropping support to download online modules...  
So I made my own app to do that! :3

**This app is not officially supported by Magisk or its developers**

**The modules shown in this app are not affiliated with this app**  
(Please contact repo owners instead)

## Requirements

Minimum:
- Android 5.0+
- Magisk 19.0+
- An internet connection

Recommended:
- Android 6.0+
- Magisk 21.2+
- An internet connection

Note: This app may require the use of a VPN in countries with a state wide firewall.

## For users

To install the app go to [releases](https://github.com/Fox2Code/FoxMagiskModuleManager/releases), 
and download and install the latest `.apk` on your device, or get the app on F-Droid.

The app currently use these three repo as it's module sources, with it's benefits and drawback:  
(Note: Each module repo can be disabled in the settings of the app)  
(NoteÂ²: I do not own or monitor any of the repo, **download at your own risk**)

[https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Alt-Repo](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Alt-Repo)  
- Accepting new modules [here](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Alt-Repo/submission)
- Less restrictive than the original repo
- Officially supported by Fox's mmm

[https://www.androidacy.com/modules-repo/](https://www.androidacy.com/modules-repo/)
- Accepting new modules [here](https://www.androidacy.com/module-repository-applications/)
- Modules downloadable easily outside the app
- Officially supported by Fox's mmm
- Contains ads

[https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo)  
- No longer accept new modules or receive update to existing modules
- May be shut down at any moment
- Official app dropped support for it
- No longer supported by Fox's mmm

As the main repo may shutting down due to the main app no longer supporting it, stopped 
accepting new modules, and also no longer receive updates since the 21 December 2021.

If a module is in multiple repos, the manager will just pick the most up to date version 
of the module, allowing developers to switch repo at their own pace if they want to.

Note: If you or a friend uploaded a module and it doesn't appear in your module 
list you can disable the low quality filter in the app settings.  
Go to the [developer documentation](DEVELOPERS.md) for more info.

## For developers

The manager can read new meta keys to allow modules to customize their own entry

It also use `minApi`, `maxApi` and `minMagisk` in the `module.prop` to detect compatibility  
And support the `support` and `donate` properties to allow them to add their own support links  
And if you want to be event fancier you can setup `config` to your own config app.  
(Note: the manager use fallback values for some modules, see developer documentation for more info)

It also add new ways to control the installer ui via a new `#!` command system  
It allow module developers to have a more customizable install experience

For more information please check the [developer documentation](DEVELOPERS.md)

## For translators

See [`app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml`](https://github.com/Fox2Code/FoxMagiskModuleManager/blob/master/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml)
and [`app/src/main/res/values/arrays.xml`](https://github.com/Fox2Code/FoxMagiskModuleManager/blob/master/app/src/main/res/values/arrays.xml)

If your language is right to left you should make a copy of [`app/src/main/res/values/bools.xml`](https://github.com/Fox2Code/FoxMagiskModuleManager/blob/master/app/src/main/res/values/bools.xml)
and set `lang_support_rtl` to `true`.

Translators are not expected to have any previous coding experience.

## I want to add my own repo

To add you own repo to Fox's mmm it need to follow theses conditions:
- The module repo or at least one of it's owners must be known.
- Modules in the repo must be monitored, and malicious modules must be removed.
- Module repo must have a valid, working, automatically or frequently updated `modules.json`
  ([Example](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Alt-Repo/json/blob/main/modules.json))
  
In addition of these initial condition the repo must follow these rules:
- Repos must process and take-down off their repo module where it's removal was requested
  by their original author, even if their licences legally allow their distributions.
- Repos may collect and store "mixed anonymous data" without user permission
  (Anonymous means no personal data, usernames, email, or IP addresses)
  (Mixed means users data must be split and not that separate data is not linkable together)
- Temporary storage of IPs address without user consent is allowed for rate limiting, GeoIP,
  security reason, and must not be used for any other purpose without user consent.
  (GeoIP is the process of getting the country of an IP address)
- Repos may not collect and/or distribute any personal data without user explicit consent
- Modules owners must be aware that their modules are being hosted on the repository  
  (This rule doesn't apply for modules from `Magisk-Modules-Repo` last updated before 2022)
- Modules owners must be aware of any change made of the distributed version of their modules.

If all of these conditions are met you can open an issue for review.  
(And don't forget to include a link to the `modules.json`)

If an existing repo is not respecting theses rules please open an issue.  
If a repo is repeatedly violating these rule will be removed from the app.  
Last update of theses rules are: 6 February 2022

Please note that these rules does not apply retroactively.
If your post an issue about rules violation they must violate both the version of
the rules at the moment of the incident and the latest version of the rules.  
(This paragraph doesn't apply for legal requests or illegal behaviour)
